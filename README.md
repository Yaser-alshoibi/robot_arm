# robot_arm

To connect all parts for the robot arm, first rotate the Base 90 degrees on x-axis.
Then on top of it the Waist also rotated 90 degrees on x-axis.
Then connect Arm 01 to the Waist after rotating it 90 degrees on x-axis and z-axis.
After that, connect Arm 02 to Arm 01 after rotating it 90 degrees on x-axis and 180 degrees on z-axis.
Finally, connect the gripper rotated 180 degrees on x-axis.
All these steps are demonstrated in the stl file.
